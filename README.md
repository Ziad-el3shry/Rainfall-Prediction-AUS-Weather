## 📊 Overview

This project performs a comprehensive analysis of daily weather observations from across Australia. It aims to uncover seasonal, regional, and climatic patterns through visualizations and statistical summaries.

### Objectives:
- Clean and preprocess the raw dataset
- Visualize distributions, correlations, and trends
- Analyze rainfall, temperature, pressure, and humidity
- Support future predictive tasks (e.g., rainfall forecasting)

---

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
- Scikit-learn (for basic modeling and feature prep)

---

## 📈 Key Results

- Identified strong correlations between humidity, pressure, and rainfall
- Explored trends across different cities and seasons
- Created visual summaries (heatmaps, box plots, time series)
- Preprocessed missing values using conditional filtering and imputation
